# RASD – Real-Time Car Accident Detection System

Graduation Project – College of Artificial Intelligence, 2025

## Overview
RASD is an AI-powered system designed to detect and classify car accidents in real time using advanced object detection techniques. The system automatically identifies whether an accident is *minor* or *severe*, captures the incident image, and sends instant notifications to relevant authorities.

## Key Features
- Real-time accident detection using YOLOv11x
- Classification of accident severity (minor vs. severe)
- Automatic alert system via Firebase
- Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit
- Map integration for selecting and displaying accident locations
- Confusion matrix and performance comparison included in methodology

## Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLOv11x (custom-trained)
- Firebase
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- CSS & JavaScript for frontend enhancements

## Project Structure
- model/: Trained YOLOv11x weights and configuration
- streamlit_app/: Frontend code using Streamlit
- firebase_config/: Private key and Firebase setup
- utils/: Helper functions for image processing, alerts, etc.
- data/: Sample accident images and dataset stats

## Live Demonstration
This project was developed as part of an academic graduation requirement. All materials are intended for educational and demonstration purposes only.
